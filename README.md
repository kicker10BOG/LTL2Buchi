# LTL2Buchi

This code is not my own. It was written by NASA. 
I found it in another [project on GitHub](https://github.com/hammacher/ccs). 

I added three methods to the end of the gov.nasa.ltl.trans.Formula class:
* public static String[] getPredicates(String)
* public static String[] getPredicates(Formula)
* public String[] getPredicates()
